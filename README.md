Hi Guys!!!I am Arun.J
I have created a hospital management system when I was studying class 12 at Amrita Vidyalayam,nesapakkam,chennai.
I created it using python as a front-end programming language and MYSQL as a back-end database management system.
This menu driven program consists of patients' records(operations:add,display,search using patient's ID,update,delete),staffs' records(operations:add,display,search,delete),Bill generation,displaying piechart and bargraph based on these records which is taken as input.
First,I imported mysqlconnector to establishing a connection between python and mysql.
Then,created a function for adding patients records to mysql by getting values from user.
Then,created functions for displaying all the patients records,(searching,updating and deleting) a particular record by getting patient's ID from the user.
Second,I created a function for generating the bill.
third,I created functions for staff records.
fourth,using matplotlib module imported pyplot at starting of this program and created functions to display:
1.piechart:dividing patients' data by their respective diseases.
2.bargraph:dividing patients' data by their respective age.
Atlast,created a menu for these records.

Hope you guys will understand my progam.
